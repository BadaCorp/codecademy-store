# Codecademy Store

This project involves building a program that mimics Codecademyâ€™s own online store! The application displays products from the Codecademy store and allows the user to add them to their cart. In the cart, the user can adjust the quantity of each item and the running total will be displayed at the bottom. Lastly, the user can choose the currency for the entire application.
